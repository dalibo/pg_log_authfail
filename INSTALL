pg_log_authfail Install
==========================

To install pg_log_authfail, you should untar the pg_log_authfail tarball
anywhere you want.

You'll then need to compile it with pgxs. So the pg_config tool must be in your
path. Depending on your PostgreSQL installation, you may need to install a dev
package. Once pg_config is in your path, do "make", and then "make install".

Once it's installed, you'll need to configure PostgreSQL to make use of it:

* shared_preload_libraries='pg_log_authfail'

There are also optional parameters. To configure them, with a PostgreSQL release
older than 9.2, you first need to add the class of pg_log_authfail in
custom_variable_classes:

* custom_variable_classes = 'pg_log_authfail'

In more recent release, custom_variable_classes is no longer available but you
can still configure pg_log_authfail.

You'll be able to set the two following parameters:

* pg_log_authfail.log_destination: to choose the log destination (stderr or syslog).
    If stderr is chosen, logs will be written in standard postgresql logs.
* pg_log_authfail.syslog_facility: configure syslog_facility in case of syslog destination.
* pg_log_authfail.syslog_ident: configure syslog_ident in case of syslog destination.
* pg_log_authfail.use_log_line_prefix: default to false but if true, preprend log_line_prefix to output.

Once this configuration is done, restart PostgreSQL.
